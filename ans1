This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a list of integers, return the largest product that can be made by multiplying any three integers.

For example, if the list is [-10, -10, 5, 2], we should return 500, since that's -10 * -10 * 5.

You can assume the list has at least three integers.



##Quetsion to ask
 - Are the elements sorted? Time complexity requirement? 
 
 ## I could not solve in time..

 def three_product(array):
     # Sort the array in ascending order  
    arr.sort() 
  
    # Return the maximum of product of last  
    # three elements and product of first  
    # two elements and last element  
    return max(arr[0] * arr[1] * arr[n - 1],  
               arr[n - 1] * arr[n - 2] * arr[n - 3])
